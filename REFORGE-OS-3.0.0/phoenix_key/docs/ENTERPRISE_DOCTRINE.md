## Universal System Constitution v1.0

**Status:** CANON LAW  
**Date:** 2026-01-21  
**Authority:** Root

---

## I. PURPOSE

Phoenix Key / BootForge exists to provide:

**Sovereign, offline-capable recovery, deployment, and repair systems for environments where trust, control, and durability are mandatory.**

This includes—but is not limited to:

- Individuals
- Repair professionals
- Enterprises
- Governments
- Air-gapped or hostile environments

**We do not optimize for convenience at the expense of control.**

## II. FOUNDATIONAL LAWS (IMMUTABLE)

These laws are not versioned.  
They do not change unless the company itself is reborn.

### LAW 1 — SINGLE CANON

There is exactly one source of truth for:

- Licensing
- Entitlement
- Audit state
- Enforcement logic

**No UI, CLI, USB runtime, or API may invent its own rules.**

### LAW 2 — OFFLINE SOVEREIGNTY

All critical functionality must operate without internet access.

Online services may:
- Enhance
- Accelerate
- Distribute

They may **never** be required for core operation.

### LAW 3 — PRIVILEGE WITH PROOF

Root / elevated access is allowed only when:

- The operation requires it
- The action is auditable
- The result is deterministic

**Silent or unjustified privilege escalation is forbidden.**

### LAW 4 — DETERMINISTIC BUILDS

Given the same inputs:
- Source
- Dependencies
- Configuration

The output must be **identical and verifiable**.

**Non-determinism is treated as a defect.**

### LAW 5 — GRACE OVER DESTRUCTION

Expired or invalid licenses:
- Degrade capability
- Never brick systems
- Never destroy data

**Punitive behavior is prohibited.**

## III. AUTHORITY MODEL

### Canonical Authorities

| Authority | Role |
|-----------|------|
| Root Authority | Owns trust keys and doctrine |
| Issuer Authority | Issues licenses |
| Operational Authority | Runs services |
| User Authority | Controls hardware |

**No authority may impersonate another.**

---

## IV. PRODUCT BEHAVIOR RULES

### Enforcement

- Enforcement happens server-side, CLI-side, and USB-side
- UI-only enforcement is invalid
- Bypasses are treated as security defects

### Licensing

Licensing:
- Controls features, not access to data
- Must be verifiable offline
- Must be portable via signed token
- Must support revocation and grace periods

### Updates

- Updates must be signed
- Updates are optional
- Downgrades are allowed
- **Forced updates are forbidden**

---

## V. AUDIT & LOGGING LAW

### What is logged

- Actions
- Commands invoked
- Privilege escalation
- License state changes

### What is never logged

- User data
- Credentials
- Personal content

### Logs must be:

- Append-only
- Tamper-evident
- Exportable offline

---

## VI. ENVIRONMENT LAW

The system must support four environments without logic divergence:

| Environment | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| DEV | Fast, permissive |
| STAGING | Strict, mirrored |
| PROD | Locked, auditable |
| AIRGAP | Fully sovereign |

**Only configuration may differ.**

---

## VII. BINARY INTEGRITY LAW

Every shipped artifact must include:

- Product name
- Version
- Build timestamp
- Commit hash
- Signing status
- Entitlement matrix hash

**Unsigned artifacts are untrusted.**

---

## VIII. ETHICAL BOUNDARY

Phoenix Key / BootForge:

- Does not spy
- Does not phone home silently
- Does not lock users out of their own machines
- Does not create artificial dependency

**Trust is earned through design, not promises.**

---

## IX. AMENDMENT RULE

This doctrine may only be amended if:

1. A written amendment is drafted
2. The amendment does not violate the foundational laws
3. The amendment is versioned and archived

**Silent changes are forbidden.**

---

**This document is the law of the system.**
